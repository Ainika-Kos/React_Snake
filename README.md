## Snake explanation:
 - Snake can move
 - Snake can eat food
 - Snake grows for 3 cells after eating each food element
 - There are 9 levels, starting from 1st (1-10)
 - On each level (after eaten 5 food elements) on the board is new kind of food
 - On 10th level (after eating 45 elements) player wins
 - The game is over, if snake bumps to itself or moves outside of the board dimensions
